# parallel-roofit-scripts
This is a collection of scripts and code used in the Automated Parallel Computation of Collaborative Statistical Models project. In this project, we aim to improve performance of the [RooFit toolkit](https://root.cern.ch/roofit) through parallelization techniques. This project is a collaboration with [principal investigator Wouter Verkerke](https://www.nikhef.nl/medewerker/dr-wouter-verkerke/), the main author of RooFit, and is carried out at [NIKHEF](https://www.nikhef.nl). For more information about the project see the [Netherlands eScience Center website](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/project/automated-parallel-calculation-of-collaborative-statistical-models) or the eScience Center [eStep software portal](http://software.esciencecenter.nl/project/automated-parallel-calculation-of-collaborative-statistical-models).
